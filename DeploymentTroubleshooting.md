This page is the starting point to information and techniques to help
diagnose and troubleshoot issues when using the IBM Rational family of
products. Currently, there are four subareas of focus including
performance, integrations, and upgrades that contain common situations
that require troubleshooting. Over time, the subareas and number of
situations will grow based on feedback and perceived needs.

If you are new to troubleshooting, see [How to start a troubleshooting
assessment](HowToStartATroubleshootingAssessment).
