This page provides resources for troubleshooting issues with Rational
Team Concert (RTC) integration with Integrated Development Environments
(IDEs).

The troubleshooting situations on this page are divided into two groups:
situations that administrators are likely to encounter, and situations
that users are likely to encounter. Integrated development environments
include Rational Software Architect, Rational Software Architect for
WebSphere, Rational Application Developer, Rational Developer for System
z, Rational Developer for Power, Rational Business Developer, Worklight
Studio, Integrations Designer.

## User situations

\* [Why do I see different build errors in Rational Application
Developer than in the Rational Team Concert build
results?](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/WhyDoISeeDifferentBuildErrorsInRationalApplicationDeveloperAndInTheRTCBuildResults)
\* [Why do I get unexpected validation errors when RTC is installed
together with an
IDE?](WhyDoIGetUnexpectedValidationErrorsWhenRTCIsInstalledTogetherWithAnIDE)
