## Data collection

-   You can use the [IBM Support Assistant Lite (ISA Lite) Data
    Collector
    tool](https://jazz.net/help-dev/clm/index.jsp?re=1&topic=/com.ibm.team.concert.doc/topics/t_using_the_isal.html)
    to quickly collect diagnostic files, such as log files,
    configuration files or to run traces. This tool is bundled with CLM
    4.x and above. ISA Lite collects information about your Jazz Team
    Server environment and stores the information in a .zip archive
    file. If you have a need to open a service request with IBM Rational
    Support for further assistance, you can send the archive file with
    the data collection so that they can help diagnose and fix problems.

## Rational Support resources

If you are unable to resolve your issue using the online resources that
are available, you might need to open a [Service
Request](https://www.ibm.com/support/servicerequest) with Rational
Support.

If you can reproduce the problem, record the step to reproduce using
[Problem Steps Recorder](GuideForPSR) utility (Windows only).

Performing an [Initial Assessment](HowToStartATroubleshootingAssessment)
