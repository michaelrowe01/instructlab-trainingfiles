From Quick Deployer v1.1 **WAS single sign on (SSO)** has been
automated.

Quick Deployer v1.0 does not implement **WAS single sign on (SSO)**,
this means that if you have deployed your applications across a
distributed system you will continually be prompted to authenticate as
you move from one application to another. This topic shows how this can
be avoided by manually configuring **WAS SSO** after running the
**Install Applications** process.

## Quick Deployer WAS single sign on To configure your QD system for WAS single sign on follow the instructions contained in section **Deploying SSO on WebSphere Application Server** of [Deploying by using single sign-on authentication](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYMRC_6.0.0/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/t_deploy_single_sign-on.html?cp=SSYMRC_6.0.0‚ü®=en)
