Intermediate performance problems are initially hard to recognize and
harder to troubleshoot. The first thing to recognize is that chaos
theory and perfect storm scenarios do happen: these are generally timing
related. As an example, the garbage collection occurring during high
volume usage on a system running reports and a virus scan starts.

## Recognizing that you have a problem

Because intermediate performance issues can be hard to consistently see,
there are several tactics that have to be performed in order to
understand what scenario actually exists. Specifically:

-   Consistency
-   Timing
-   Severity

### Consistency

Consistency is important for reproducing the problem. One instance of
occurrence is sometimes once more than practical.

How do I do so for an intermittent problem?
