The IBM Internet of Things (IoT) Continuous Engineering Solution is an
integrated solution for systems lifecycle management. The combination of
products, components, and practices is built on an open integration
platform so you can share plans and requirements, model artifacts, and
manage testing while applying best practices and built-in process
guidance. The solution consists of the following products and
components:

IBM Rational License Key Server v8.1.6
:   The license manager monitors activities such as license access,
    simultaneous usage, and idle time. When you start an IBM Rational
    product, you are initially unlicensed. If a license for that product
    is available, the license manager gives you a license. You keep the
    license while you are using the product. When you exit the product,
    your license is returned to the license manager and is made
    available for another user.

IBM DOORS Next Generation v6.0.6.1
:   Rational DOORS Next Generation is a requirements management tool
    that leverages a web client and IBM Rational Jazz platform. With IBM
    Rational DOORS Next Generation, you can define and manage
    requirements in systems and software engineering projects.

IBM Rational DOORS v9.6.1.11
:   Rational DOORS software allows you to capture, trace, analyze and
    manage changes to requirements and helps you to demonstrate
    compliance to regulations and standards.

IBM Rational DOORS Web Access v9.6.1.11
:   Rational DOORS Web Access enables stakeholders, including business
    managers, development, QA, customers, and suppliers, to easily
    create, elaborate and validate requirements within a web browser.
    This can help avoid errors early in the development lifecycle and
    reduce project costs.

IBM Rational Rhapsody Design Manager v6.0.6.1
:   Rational Rhapsody Design Manager enables you to share, collaborate
    and manage your designs across the systems engineering and embedded
    software development lifecycle.

IBM Rhapsody Model Manager 6.0.6.1
:   This product helps teams to make Rhapsody models a full part of the
    development lifecycle with advanced configuration management and
    traceability. With Rhapsody Model Manager you can link model
    elements in Rhapsody to requirements in DOORS and DOORS Next
    Generation to validate requirements as you derive architecture.

IBM Rational Rhapsody v8.4
:   Rational Rhapsody helps systems engineers and embedded software
    developers analyze, design, develop, test, and deliver embedded,
    real-time systems and software.

IBM Rational Team Concert v6.0.6.1
:   Rational Team Concert is a team collaboration tool that is built on
    a scalable, extensible platform. Rational Team Concert provides
    features that integrate development project tasks including
    iteration planning, process definition, change management, defect
    tracking, source control, build automation, and reporting.

IBM Rational Quality Manager v6.0.6.1
:   Rational Quality Manager is a collaborative, web-based tool that
    offers comprehensive test planning, test construction, and test
    artifact management functions throughout the software development
    lifecycle.

IBM Rational Jazz Reporting Service v6.0.6.1
:   Jazz Reporting Service is the default reporting solution for the IoT
    Continuous Engineering Solution. It is an alternative to the complex
    reporting capabilities that are available in many Rational products
    and solutions. The table in the article The new reporting options in
    version 6.0 helps you figure out what reporting option is best for
    you.

IBM Rational Global Configuration Management v6.0.6.1
:   Global Configuration Management (GCM) is an application that
    assembles configurations for itself and other contributing
    applications so teams can gain an overall view of the physical and
    logical parts of their product offering.

IBM Rational Link Index Provider v6.0.6.1
:   When project areas are enabled for configurations, for team members
    to see, use, create, or remove links across project areas, a Jazz
    administrator must install the Global Configuration Management (GCM)
    and Link Index Provider (LDX) applications.

IBM Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager v6.0.6.1
:   Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager enhances the IoT Continuous
    Engineering Solution by providing the capability to visualize,
    analyze, and organize systems product engineering data coming from
    many tools. Engineering teams get a better understanding of the
    relationships in that data, so they can make more effective and
    timely decisions.
