## Product documentation contents

The Rational product documentation in IBM Knowledge Center provides
basic guidance for installation, configuration, and general use of the
products.

Content that is published outside the product documentation, such as in
this Deployment wiki, further illustrates topics and concepts, provides
deployment-specific examples, and puts common questions and knowledge
into context.

This topic provides links to IBM Knowldege Center, as well as some tips
and tricks for using them effectively. See [Finding information: Wiki,
product documentation, or IBM Support Portal?](WikiICSupportPortal) for
details about where the content is located.

### The Jazz.net information center

The Jazz.net IC provides the help for the latest milestone of the next
product version. It always has the same URL, but the contents change
frequently. Because it is under development, it can easily provide
incomplete information or information that is unrelated to released
versions of the products.

### IBM Knowledge Center

For most Rational products, a new version of the product help is
published for each release of the product. You can see all of the
version of the documentation available for a product from the navigation
panel in IBM Knowledge Center. Verify that you are looking at the right
version of the documentation because following the guidance for a
different version of the product than you are using can lead to
complications and provide the wrong information.
