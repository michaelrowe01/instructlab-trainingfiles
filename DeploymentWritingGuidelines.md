These minimal writing guidelines are listed in alphabetical order and
focus on style issues that relate to clarity and consistency within a
wiki page. The links to further guidelines lead to internal information
that is available to IBM employees only.

For detailed information about how to create wiki pages and how to
complete and format the different sections of wiki pages, see
[Deployment wiki formatting guidance](DeploymentFormattingGuidance).

## Abbreviations

-   For all abbreviations that might not be known by the audience, spell
    out the abbreviation at the first instance on the page and include
    the abbreviation in parentheses after it.

<!-- -->

-   Remember that not all spelled-out forms of abbreviations use initial
    capital letters (if you are unsure, your UA contacts can advise on
    this matter). **Correct:** Interactive System Productivity Facility
    (ISPF) **Correct:** service-oriented architecture (SOA) **Correct:**
    Rational solution for Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM)

<!-- -->

-   IBM authors and editors can find more information about
    abbreviations in IBM Style: Abbreviations.

## Capitalization

-   Applying a uniform style of capitalization helps information look
    consistent and unified from a high level.

<!-- -->

-   Use a lowercase style, which is known as "sentence-style"
    capitalization.

<!-- -->

-   In sentence-style capitalization, you capitalize only the first word
    in a title, heading, or subheading (and any other words that must be
    capitalized, such as proper nouns). **Incorrect:** Installing,
    Upgrading, and Migrating **Correct:** Installing, upgrading, and
    migrating

    capitalization in IBM Style: Capitalization.

    unsubstantiated claims or violate copyrights. future-proof guarantee
    I recommend, recommended unzip, unzipped: Use "extract" or
    "extracted." us we zip, zip file, zipped file, ZIP, .ZIP: Use ".zip
    file" or "compress" or "compressed file."

    terms in IBM Word Usage.

## First person

-   Do not use the first person, which is indicated by the personal
    pronouns *I, me, my, we, us, and our.*

<!-- -->

-   The first person can cause confusion over whether the writing
    represents an individual, group, or company and can also cause
    liability issues.

<!-- -->

-   Instead, focus the information on the user and use the imperative
    mood or the second person, which is indicated by the personal
    pronoun *you.* **Incorrect:** We can start by considering the
    deployment scenario. **Correct:** Start by considering the
    deployment scenario. **Correct:** You can start by considering the
    deployment scenario.

    names in external information.

    **Correct:** Jazz Team Server, Rational Team Concert, WebSphere

    dictionary.
