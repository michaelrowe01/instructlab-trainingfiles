Each of the ELM applications includes extensive value-added capabilities
that when used properly help customers improve their development
processes and meet their business goals. As with many applications,
there are multiple ways to accomplish the same outcome. The ELM
applications are no different in that regard. They too can be configured
in optimal and not so optimal ways.

How customers use and configure a ELM application is called a **usage
model**. This page is a collection point for gathering various usage
best practices.
