Adopting new systems or software engineering tools and practices on a
large scale is a significant technological and organizational challenge
that requires an appropriate level of coordination, collaboration, and
governance to be successful.

This article outlines a best-practice organizational model to ensure
successful adoption, based on establishing a software engineering
process center of excellence (COE).

## What is a center of excellence and why do I need one?

The following is a good working definition of a center of excellence
from [Strickler, J. (2008)](#RefOne):

*The Center of Excellence should, at a most basic level consist of: A
team of people that promote collaboration and using best practices
around a specific focus area to drive business results. This team could
be staffed with full- or part-time members.*

*The Center of Excellence should serve five basic needs:*

-   **Support:** *For their area of focus, Center of Excellences should
    offer support to the business lines. This may be through services
    needed, or providing subject matter experts.*
-   **Guidance:** *Standards, methodologies, tools and knowledge
    repositories are typical approaches to filling this need.*
-   **Shared Learning:** *Training and certifications, knowledge
    sharing, skill assessments are all ways to encourage shared
    learning.*
-   **Measurements:** *Center of Excellences should be able to
    demonstrate they are delivering the value that justified their
    creation.*
-   **Governance:** *Allocating limited resources (money, people, etc.)
    across all their possible uses is an important function of Center of
    Excellences. They should ensure organizations invest in the most
    valuable activities and create economies of scale for their service
    offering. In addition, coordination across other corporate interests
    is needed to enable the Center of Excellence to deliver value.*

Where software or systems engineering is being performed on a
large-scale, organizations that take a systematic approach to addressing
those needs gain greater return-on-investment from their investment in
the practices and tools, and are able to reap the benefits much earlier.

ICON{note} This article uses the term *center of excellence* to refer to
any similar entity with the same purpose and goals. The goals of a
center of excellence are to mentor project staff, provide internal
training, assess innovative software engineering solutions and manage
adoption and continuous improvement. Other similar concepts and terms
are *Center of Competency (COC)* and *Community of Practice (COP)*, and
these might encompass organizational types from Software Engineering
Process Groups (SEPGs), project management offices (PMOs), quality
groups, architecture teams, subject matter expert (SME) groups, and
deployment organizations.

## COE organizational model

The *center of excellence (COE)* is a centrally coordinated team
consisting of a pool of skilled resources with expert knowledge around
the software or systems engineering ecosystem; tool installation and
configuration; usage models; practices and methods; and enablement and
adoption.

The center of excellence is often organized into four main groups, as
shown in [Figure One](#FigOne):

1\. Executive steering committee 1. Program management 1. Common
services group 1. Working groups

Each group is described in detail later in this article.

BR \#FigOne *Figure One: center of excellence: an operating model for
successful improvement*

### 1. Executive steering committee [executive-steering-committee]

The *Executive Steering Committee (ESC)* is the decision-making body and
escalation route for the center of excellence. Members of the steering
committee typically include: a chairperson, one or more Tools Solution
Architects, representation from the Software Engineering Process Group,
and representation from the user and stakeholder community.

The executive steering committee is ultimately accountable for the
success of the center of excellence and is responsible for ensuring that
the software engineering solutions supported by the center of excellence
deliver the expected benefits to the organization as a whole.

The key responsibilities of the executive steering committee are
typically to provide overall direction for the initiative and to ensure
that the expected benefits are achieved; to communicate the goals and
status of the change initiative to sponsors and key stakeholders; to
establish and maintain appropriate governance and to act as an
escalation point for decisions that cannot be made locally.

### 2. Program management [program-management]

The Program Management group is responsible for the operational aspects
of the center of excellence, such as:

-   Planning of COE activities
-   Communications
-   Managing the relationships with tool vendors, third-party
    consultants, and others for products and services within the scope
    of the COE
-   Measurement & reporting
-   Financial management
-   Program management of COE initiatives, such as tools adoptions

### 3. Common services group [common-services-group]

The *Common Services Group (CSG)* is a team responsible for the
"cross-cutting" activities undertaken within the center of excellence,
such as tool support and maintenance; method and process development and
improvement; and enablement planning and delivery.

BR \#FigTwo *Figure Two: Common Services Group Structure*

The *Common Services Group* is often staffed by a relatively small
number of dedicated resources and is supplemented by external
consultants and volunteer resources from the user community, as
necessary, during specific initiatives. The group is typically
accountable for providing these types of services:

**Tools strategy**

-   Developing the tools strategy and roadmap
-   Preparing and planning the tools environment

**Tools environment administration**

-   Establishing the tools environment
-   Getting new users started
-   Managing user accounts
-   Setting up tools environments
-   Software licenses management
-   Monitoring the tools environment
-   Maintaining and upgrading the tools environment
-   Project administration

**Process improvement**

-   Developing initial processes and practices
-   Continuous improvement of processes and practices
-   Monitoring process adherence

**Process and tool enablement**

-   Creation and maintenance of training materials
-   Identifying training needs
-   Managing development or acquisition of training
-   Delivery of training

**Process and tool mentoring**

-   Development of process and tool subject matter experts (SMEs)
-   Provision of mentoring to end users on tools and process

ICON{note} Within your organization, you might have dedicated teams that
are responsible for the delivery of some of these services; for example,
training delivery or infrastructure and tool support. In that case, the
role of the CSG is to ensure that the services provided meet the needs
of the solution and its practitioners and to coordinate any interaction
with these teams.

### 4. Working groups [working-groups]

Where there is a large-scale adoption effort requiring support from the
center of excellence, a common pattern is to establish a series of local
*working groups*, formed of nominated representatives from the end-user
community based on their role or expertise, together with key
stakeholders. They influence and manage the way the solution is adopted
locally for their area and to coordinate with the other working groups.

Working groups are responsible for ensuring adoption and optimization of
the solution within their area of responsibility and for coordination
with other working groups around interdependent activities. The working
group is accountable for these tasks:

**Supporting solution design**

\* Designing the elements of the solution that are associated with their
area of focus, including: \* Deciding which tools and processes to adopt
\* Defining applicable tool usage models \* Identifying any required
adaptation or tailoring of the tool configuration or process for their
area \* Validating the tool configuration \* Identifying best practices

**Capability deployment and improvement**

\* Defining the adoption approach and plan \* Identification of pilot
projects \* Coordination of deployment or improvement activities \*
Obtaining feedback on adoption and usage \* Responding to requests for
assistance from specific projects \* Marshaling point for requests for
assistance from the community \* Prioritization of resources to support
these requests \* Coordination with the Common Services Group \*
Coordination with other working groups \* Tracking requests to closure

**Measurement and reporting**

-   Identification of appropriate measures for their area
-   Capturing of metrics
-   Reporting adoption progress and benefits to the stakeholders
-   Escalating any risks or issues to the Executive Steering Committee

The number of working groups is specific to your organization and
depends on factors such as the structure of the organization, the number
of discipline areas, the availability of resources and expertise, and
the expected rate of adoption.

To illustrate this, [Figure Three](#FigThree) shows an example working
group structure to support an adoption effort covering three disciplines
across two business units. In this example, *Business Unit Two* is
geo-dispersed and so has formed subgroups within each geographic
location.

\#FigThree *Figure Three: Example Working Group Structure*

The two business units are both adopting the same tools and practices,
but there will naturally be differences in the way the tools are used
within each. Each might require different tool configurations and have
different enablement and mentoring requirements. In addition, the
priorities for adoption by the practitioners, the availability of
champions and mentors, and the level of support and mentoring provided
might also differ. The relevant local working groups are responsible for
taking these factors into account and making the appropriate local
decisions.

This working group structure aims to provide a scalable and manageable
framework for empowerment, flexibility, visibility, and sharing of
assets and best practices, while ensuring a consistent and coordinated
approach across the adoption program as a whole.

[Figure Four](#FigFour) below illustrates a potential operating model
for each working group.

BR \#FigFour *Figure Four: Working Group Operating Model*

**Managing and tracking working group activities**

Each working group is expected to manage their own backlog of work.
However, in order to maximize reuse and minimize duplication of effort,
this backlog must be visible to the other working groups. For example,
it should be possible to see all Requirements Working Group activities,
and *all* Working Group activities at a business unit level.

## COE staffing profile

The staffing profile of the overall center of excellence is typically
divided into two key categories: **Transitional** and **Permanent**
resources.

### Transitional resources [transitional-resources]

These are resources that are temporarily assigned to the initiative in
order to perform the planning and mobilization, the solution
development, and the initial enablement and adoption activities.
Typically, these resources are assigned specifically to an initiative
design to drive the implementation of the solution, or are resources
from third-parties, such as tool vendors or external consultants.

As the solution transitions into a steady state, it is expected that the
number of transitional resources will reduce as resources are either no
longer required or move into a business-as-usual role.

### Permanent resources [permanent-resources]

As the solution moves into a steady state, resources are required to
support and maintain the solution over time. The majority of these
resources are in the Common Services Group and provide a combination of
support and maintenance activities and continuous improvement
activities. Often, the funding for these resources transfers from a
"change-the-business" initiative model to a "run-the-business" model.

BR \#FigFive *Figure Five: Staffing Profile*

## Communities of practice

A \_Community of Practice (CoP)\_ is a community of individuals who
share a common interest in learning from each other and sharing
knowledge around a given capability area. Members of the CoP generally
discuss relevant topics and issues, identify reusable assets, share best
practice, define guidelines, and help each other in order to be
productive in their daily activities. Communities of practice are
typically formed around a given discipline or capability area or
role-set.

If you do not already have a CoP, consider creating one during adoption
to give further impetus to the deployment and provide opportunity for
the community to share experiences and best practices.

Think about appropriate ways to establish CoPs and how to encourage
participation from within the practitioner community.

-   Ideally, each CoP should have a dedicated leader assigned on a
    rolling periodic basis (for example, one or two years) that sets up
    and runs the community.
-   Community participation should become a personal commitment for
    practitioners, and participation should be recognized and encouraged
    by management.
-   Appropriate resources should be made available, such as forums and
    other collaboration spaces, community events and projects,
    newsletters.
