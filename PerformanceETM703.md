## Updates from [previous report](702PerformanceReportIBMEngineeringTestManagement): This report provides an update to IBM Engineering Test Management (ETM) 7.0.3 performance and scalability test, from the [7.0.2 release](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/702PerformanceReportIBMEngineeringTestManagement).

#### Datashape

In this release, the datashape has been evolved as outlined below

-   Number of components: total number of components is increased from
    2,511 to 10,011
-   Repository size\[1\]: increased from 22 million to 34 million total
    artifacts, or by 55
-   ETM Database size on disk has grown from 1.2TB to 2.2TB
-   Component size\[1\]:
    -   added small (\<1K), medium (5K), and large (50K) sizes
    -   keeping extra large (500K) and extra-extra-large (10M) sizes

\[1\]: measured by total number of versioned artifacts generated by the
[Data Generation Tool](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/RQMDatagen)
which collects the sum from each artifact type visible in the UI.

The size and number of different components are summarized in the table

#### Configuration test coverage

The performance and load tests of small, medium, and large sized
components are evaluated under Global Configuration (GC) for this
release. The GC component is consisted of all 10,000 ETM components. The
extra and extra-extra large sized components remain to be tested against
their local ETM configurations including both streams and baselines for
regression purpose.

#### Disclaimer

The extra-extra-large sized component was created initially to expedite
the growth of the repository without consideration of artifact versions
(i.e. the artifacts were generated in an opt-out environment prior to
the enablement of Configuration Management feature). The test against
this particular component was initially experimental during 7.0, but it
continuously serves as a way to regression test the performance of IBM
IBM Engineering Test Management (ETM). The results using this component
can represent edge cases due to its huge size, thus the measurement for
the performance of this component shown in the report should be looked
at and analyzed as a comparison of the performance of different releases
in the context of datashape. It should not be deemed as a performance
benchmark.

#### 7.0.3 GA vs 7.0.3 iFix004 Migration Service Issue

Its important to be aware the results below were tested on 7.0.3
iFix004. This was specifically to pickup fixes for a known migration
service issue which occurs on some very large scale ETM servers. The
issue is related to reduced server performance while one of the
background migration processes continues to run. It is not typically an
issue for most environments. But it was an important fix for our
environment. So our team encourages large scale users to pickup the
newest ETM iFix to avoid the issue.

## Summary of regression test results

We continue to find the following performance characteristics as we keep
increasing the size of the repository

#### Component performance vs. component size For any given repository size, generally:

\* The smaller a component, the faster page response times or better
performance for that component. Under the 34 million repository, for
components that have a size ranged from small to large, 99 of the
individual page response times are under 2 seconds (with the exception
of Saving a test plan may take 5 seconds due to large amount of
iterations defined); whereas 11 out of 120 pages are exceeding 5 seconds
for the extra-large component, most of these slower pages are
browsing/searching a given artifact type that has a larger total count,
including searching/filtering test case results (9 seconds) and test
case records (5.5 seconds) in the default views within a stream.

The detailed analysis of the component performance as a function of
component size can be found in [ETM 7.0.1 Performance
Report](ELMLargeScaleAndPerformanceReportRelease701). Its worthy to note
that since the component size can vary substantially, each of the
individual test load was only focused on homogeneously sized components.
Carrying out test loads this way not only leads to statistically
normalization of page response times, but also allows servers to warmup
thoroughly and database become more optimal.

#### Component performance vs. growing repository size

-   The general performance of a given component\[2\] degrades as the
    repository size grows. Although the measurements based on
    extra-extra-large sized component stress tested some edge cases, we
    observed a projection of a slight degradation when comparing between
    the 20-million and smaller repositories. The degradation degree for
    500K component is still minor under 34-million repository (average
    page response time for all pages degraded by less than 10, comparing
    to 20-million repository).
-   Within a component context, the pages that are more sensitive to the
    size of the entire repository include those embracing the largest
    test artifact counts. Examples seen in our test environment, page
    Browse Test Case Execution Records (total count of 4 million in a
    single component, or 30 of total artifact count in the repository),
    Browse Test Case Results, and the relevant pages to search/filter
    the test artifact.

For a detailed analysis of the component performance as a function of
repository size, please refer to [ETM 7.0.1 Performance
Report](ELMLargeScaleAndPerformanceReportRelease701).

\[2\]: component size did not grow prior to the performance load test.

#### Regression Test Results for ETM 7.0.3 with 34 million resources on Oracle The following chart shows our ETM 7.0.3 performance benchmark with:

-   1000 concurrent users
-   34 million resources
-   Oracle 19c
-   User accessing small components inside of a GC configuration with
    10,000 component leafs

The performance benchmark specifically shows the "Top 10 slowest Page
Operations". Response times were slightly better than the ETM 7.0.2 1000
user performance benchmark with 22million artifacts. As noted earlier 99
of the individual page response times are under 2 seconds with the
exception of "Saving a test plan" which may take 5 seconds.

## Whats not in scope of test for this release Like all previous releases, scalability that may be impacted by any of the following dimensions are not covered in 7.0.3 tests -

-   The growth of number of baselines for a given component or stream
-   The growth of number of versions for a given configuration
-   The growth of number of states for a given artifact
