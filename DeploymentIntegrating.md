# Integrating DKGRAY Section technical leaders and senior editors: Main.AmySilberbauer, Main.DaleHobill ENDCOLOR [integrating-dkgray-section-technical-leaders-and-senior-editors-main.amysilberbauer-main.dalehobill-endcolor]

This section of the wiki provides resources for understanding how to
configure and manage integrations between the core Rational ALM products
(referred to as **ALM Core**), across the IBM DevOps end-to-end solution
set of products and, as possible, in heterogeneous environments
involving third-party tooling integrations with the **ALM Core**. The
Rational products support a wide variety of integration "types":

-   Import/Export
-   Data sharing through adapters, proprietary engines, bridges, and
    synchronizers
-   Programmatic integration through product APIs - [API Landing
    Page](ELMProductAPILanding)

Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) plays a growing role in
Rational integrations; OSLC is a standards-based technology to enable
artifact creation, linking, and data sharing across applications.
