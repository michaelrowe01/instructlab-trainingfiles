## Posting scripts and sample code to the Deployment wiki

There may be instances when it would be beneficial for the Deployment
wiki community to have access to scripts and sample code, or other
relevant material, which relates to a given wiki topic page. When this
is the case, please follow the steps outlined in this below to ensure
that your files adhere to the necessary legal/intellectual property
guidelines.

Complete the [Jazz.net Sample Code
Checklist](https://jazz.net/jazz02/service/com.ibm.team.workitem.service.internal.rest.IAttachmentRestService/repo/csid/Attachment/Jazz.net_DeploymentWiki_Code_Checklist_08272013.doc?itemId=_LLNu4BWpEeOHC7C9LI8rFQ)
document and have it reviewed by the appropriate jazz.net IP personnel
(Karice Mcintyre or Duong Nguyen). If you answer **No** to any of the
questions in the checklist, approval to make it available on jazz.net
may take additional time.

Steps to obtain clearance for sample code that will be made available on
jazz.net:

-   Create a work item (Type: Task) in the [JazzCS
    repository](https://jazz.net/jazz02/web/projects/JazzCS#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWelcome).
-   Example work item: [Deployment Wiki Sample Code Approval: Example
    approval
    task](https://jazz.net/jazz02/web/projects/JazzCS#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=94362).
-   Prefix the Summary with "Deployment Wiki Sample Code Approval:".
-   Add tag samplecode.
-   Provide a brief description of the script or sample code (purpose,
    function).
-   Ensure appropriate copyright notice is included in the files (Java,
    JavaScript, XML, properties files, etc). See **Copyright Notice
    Guidance**, below.
-   Attach source code (for scanning purposes) to work item.
-   Include URL to the wiki topic page that the script or sample code
    will be attached to.
-   Compete the Jazz.net Deployment wiki code checklist and attach to
    the work item. [Template attached to example work
    item](https://jazz.net/jazz02/service/com.ibm.team.workitem.service.internal.rest.IAttachmentRestService/repo/csid/Attachment/Jazz.net_DeploymentWiki_Code_Checklist_08272013.doc?itemId=_LLNu4BWpEeOHC7C9LI8rFQ).
-   Create an approval on the work item. Add the appropriate approver(s)
    from IP and the business (currently Karice Mcintyre or Duong
    Nguyen).
-   Jazz.net IP personnel will review the script or sample code in
    approximately **2-5 business days** and provide feedback. If there
    are action items, they must be resolved before the script or sample
    code can be made available within the Deployment wiki.
-   When the work item is Approved, the script or sample code **MUST**
    be compress into an archive (e.g. zip, tar) with the [license
    files](https://jazz.net/jazz02/service/com.ibm.team.workitem.service.internal.rest.IAttachmentRestService/repo/csid/Attachment/jazz.net-deployment-wiki-code-license.zip?itemId=_M02mMRWpEeOHC7C9LI8rFQ)
    and the single archive file can be attached to the relevant topic
    page in the Deployment wiki. Content will be made available under
    the IBM License Agreement for Non-warranted programs, which is
    perpetual.
