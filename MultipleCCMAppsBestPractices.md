This document collects best practices to work with Multiple CCM
applications in large size enterprise deployment topologies.

## Introduction

Sizing should be one of the continuously performed activities when
keeping tools in operation. Servers can only maintain certain loads and
back up becomes challenging as data size grows. It is a best practice to
plan for the growth potential of your deployment. If the expected amount
of concurrent users exceeds the amount that the server can handle,
consider using multiple CCM instances.
