This page provides resources for troubleshooting Jazz product
integrations with IBM Rational DOORS.

The troubleshooting situations on this page are divided into two groups:
situations that administrators are likely to encounter, and situations
that users are likely to encounter.

## User situations

-   Why can't I create a link from a Rational Quality Manager or
    Rational Team Concert artifact to a Rational DOORS object?
-   Why can't I create a link from a Rational DOORS object to an
    artifact in Rational Team Concert or Rational Quality Manager?
-   Why can't I see the RQM menu in DOORS?
-   Why is the RQM-Test Report in DOORS not showing my test case and
    test results?
-   Why is the Select Requirement Collection from DOORS dialog appearing
    blank in Rational Quality Manager?
-   Linking a requirement to a IBM Rational Design Manager resource
    leads to the error "CRCRD7211Q: Could not create backlink for object
    XX"
-   Why don't I see my RCR in the RCR selection list?
-    Why does the DOORs Web Access requirement selection picker display
    as a blank blue page when initiating a link request using the RTC
    Eclipse client?
-   How to verify link consistency between RQM and DOORS 9

## Administrator situations

-   Why can't I create a friend or project association between Rational
    DOORS and a Jazz product?
-   How to debug CLM integrations with DOORS
-   Verifying server hostnames
-   Checking version compatibility for any OSLC integrations
