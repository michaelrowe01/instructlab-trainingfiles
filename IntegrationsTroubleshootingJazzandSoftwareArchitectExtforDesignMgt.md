This page provides resources for troubleshooting Jazz product
integrations with IBM Rational Software Architect Extension for Design
Management.

The troubleshooting situations on this page are divided into two groups:
situations that administrators are likely to encounter, and situations
that users are likely to encounter.

## User situations

\* [Linking a requirement to a IBM Rational Design Manager resource
leads to the error "CRCRD7211Q: Could not create backlink for object
XX"](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21632325)

## Administrator situations

\* [Why can't I associate a Design Management project area to a Rational
Team Concert or Rational Quality Manager project
area?](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/WhyAmINotAbleToAssociateADesignManagerProjectAreaToARationalTeamConcertProjectArea)
