## Bio [bio]

John and his team provide Rational tooling and other development
life-cycle services to IBM's software development community based in the
UK and beyond. He has established a Jazz service hosting almost 100
repositories supporting a number of organisations, both large and small,
comprising more than 20,000 users worldwide. He is currently in the
process of upgrading his service to CLM V5.0.1.

As an agile evangelist John has also assisted teams with their adoption
of agile methodologies. As this has often happened in tandem with their
adoption of Jazz, John has facilitated a number of engagements to enable
teams to get the most from Jazz in transforming their businesses to
support a continuous delivery model.
