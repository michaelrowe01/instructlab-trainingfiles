# Finding information: Wiki, information centers, or IBM Support Portal? [finding-information-wiki-information-centers-or-ibm-support-portal]

DKGRAY Authors: Main.RalphEarle, Main.StevenBeard ENDCOLOR

TOC{title="Page contents"}

Customers often ask the difference between content in the Deployment
wiki, the help information centers (ICs), and the IBM Support Portal.
The following sections provide guidelines for locating content and for
developing it.

Some content is developed iteratively in the wiki as the processes and
best practices evolve; for example, CLM monitoring. As the content
becomes stable, it moves into the IC.

It is a best practice to include content in one location only. Other
locations can include a brief, general summary with a link.

## Information that belongs in this wiki

-   Content that is specific to a unique or unusual system environment
-   Content that is subject to alternative approaches, opinions, or
    untested variations
-   Performance tuning information
-   Performance datasheets and case studies
-   Official scenario baselines
-   System requirements
-   Version compatibility
-   Security considerations for complex deployments
-   Troubleshooting: It is the intention for internal IBM teams, such as
    Customer Support, to capture troubleshooting information in wiki as
    it is learned
-   High-priority updates that occurred after the deadline for IC
    content

The information centers can contain general, high-level information on
this content, with pointers into the wiki.

**All deployment-related guidance and best practices that would have
been published as Jazz.net articles are now being published in the
Deployment wiki. This includes guidance and best practices in these
areas:**

-   [Deployment planning and design](DeploymentPlanningAndDesign)
-   [Installing, upgrading and
    migrating](DeploymentInstallingUpgradingAndMigrating)
-   [Integrating](DeploymentIntegrating)
-   [Administering](DeploymentAdminstering)
-   [Monitoring](DeploymentMonitoring)
-   [Troubleshooting](DeploymentTroubleshooting)
-   [Cloud deployment](CloudDeployment)

**Existing deployment-related Jazz.net articles that are still relevant
or need to be updated will be migrated to the Deployment wiki over time,
following the guidance for [Migrating Jazz.net articles to the
Deployment wiki](DeploymentGuidanceOnMigratingArticles).**

## Information that belongs in the ICs

-   Content that is robust and stable
-   Officially supported installation and upgrade processes
-   Interactive installation and upgrade guides
-   Configuration information
-   Standard security considerations
-   Standard usage information

For links to the latest product information centers and a discussion of
different information center versions, see [Help information
centers](InformationCenter).

## Information that belongs in the IBM Support Portal

-   Product alerts
-   Product fix packs
-   Problem resolution information
-   Product technotes

You can customize your [IBM Support
Portal](http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/overview) page to filter
content that is related to the products that you select.
