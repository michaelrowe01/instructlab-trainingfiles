Many customers will want to customize their Jazz solutions, providing
tailored extensions and specific customizations to their Jazz solutions.
This will often involve extending the Jazz solution, and use of the Jazz
API, OSLC, or other mechanisms to access the linked data.

## Jazz APIs

The "official" Jazz API is now available for download on the downloads
page, in the Plain Zips section, under Plain Java Client Libraries and
Plain Java Client Libraries API Documentation. The article [Rational
Team Concert plain Java API's](https://jazz.net/library/article/1229) is
an introduction into how they work. Customers wishing to write process
extensions for their Jazz implementation should begin with the [RTC
extensions workshop](https://jazz.net/library/article/1000), the
[Process enactment workshop](https://jazz.net/library/article/1093), and
the [OSLC workshop](https://jazz.net/library/article/635). This will
help them better understand the various different options for extending
and enhancing the Jazz solution, and will provide valuable insight into
how to implement the needed customizations.
