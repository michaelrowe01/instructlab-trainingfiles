For a short list of track changes to this article please see the bottom
of this article. For prior release requirements please see the specific
articles for each version listed below:

-   The system requirements for SSE v4.0.3 were published in [this
    article](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/SSESystemRequirements403).
-   The system requirements for SSE v4.0.5 and v4.0.6 are published in
    [this
    article](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/SSESystemRequirements405).

CLM 5.0, 5.0.1, and 5.0.2 system requirements are published in [this
article](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/CLMSystemRequirements50).

-   This is the list of system requirements for \*Rational systems and
    software engineering (SSE) 5.0, 5.0.1, and 5.0.2 incorporating:

| Product | SSE 5.0 Version | SSE 5.0.1 Version | SSE 5.0.2 Version |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Rational DOORS and DOORS Web Access (DWA) | 9.6 | 9.6.0.1 | 9.6.1 |
| Rational DOORS Next Generation (DNG) | 5.0 | 5.0.1 | 5.0.2 |
| Rational Team Concert (RTC) | 5.0 | 5.0.1 | 5.0.2 |
| Rational Rhapsody | 8.1 | 8.1.1 | 8.1.2 |
| Rational Rhapsody Design Manager | 5.0 | 5.0.1 | 5.0.2 |
| Rational Engineering Lifecycle Manager (RELM) | 5.0 | 5.0.1 | 5.0.2 |

\* ***Please Note:*** From SSE 5.0 onward, Rational Requirements
Composer (RRC) has been renamed to Rational DOORS Next Generation
(RDNG).

The system requirements are broken down into various components. These
are the most commonly supported platforms and middleware, for additional
options please refer to the individual product system requirements. For
recommended deployment topologies please refer to:
<https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/RecommendedSSEDeploymentTopologies>

RED **Please Note: From SSE 5.0 onwards, RDNG's data is no longer stored
in the JTS database. Rather, RDNG's has it's own RM database. Because of
this change in where the data is stored, the steps for the upgrade
procedure significantly changed. Compared to the procedure to upgrade to
version 4.x, the procedure to upgrade to version 5.0 or later from 4.x
has more steps. Please see [Migrating the RM application to V5 from
V4.x: Tips, common problems, and
workarounds](RM4to5MigrationTipsTricksProblemsAndSolutions) and [Running
the RM upgrade script for version
5.0](RunningTheRMUpgradeScriptForVersion50).** ENDCOLOR

RED **Please Note: Starting in RTC 5.0, you can choose to migrate data
from an older version of the product to the latest product version while
the production server is still online. This migration method is called
pre-upgrade online migration. Before implementing an online migration,
determine whether offline or online migration is warranted for your
repository by running the migration estimation command and then checking
the [Rational Team Concert online migration test
matrix](RationalTeamConcertOnlineMigrationTestMatrix) for guidance on
the results. If online migration is recommended for your repository,
follow the detailed instructions in the [Collaborative Lifecycle
Management 5.0 Knowledge Center, Interactive upgrade
guide](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYMRC_5.0.0/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/roadmap_clm_upgrade.html),
[Collaborative Lifecycle Management 5.0.1 Knowledge Center, Interactive
upgrade
guide](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYMRC_5.0.1/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/roadmap_clm_upgrade.html)
and [Collaborative Lifecycle Management 5.0.2 Knowledge Center,
Interactive upgrade
guide](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYMRC_5.0.2/com.ibm.jazz.install.doc/topics/roadmap_clm_upgrade.html)
respectively.** ENDCOLOR

RED **Please Note: When using an Oracle database for RTC, workspaces and
streams become disconnected from internal configuration information
during migration from RTC 4.x to RTC 5.0 or later, causing some of the
SCM functionality to become unusable. Please see the
[NullPointerExceptions occur with Oracle DB after upgrade to Rational
Team Concert
5.0](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21676229) Technote
for more information.** ENDCOLOR

RED **Please Note: Starting in SSE 5.0.2, Lifecycle Project
Administration (LPA) is now a component of the Jazz Team Server (JTS).
Prior to 5.0.2, it was a separate application. Because of this change,
some steps of the upgrade procedure have changed. Please see [Migrating
the LPA application from 4.0.x, 5.0 or 5.0.1 to 5.0.2 or
higher](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/LifecycleProjectAdmin#Migrating_the_LPA_application_to)**
