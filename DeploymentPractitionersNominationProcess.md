The Deployment wiki community encourages IBM customers and IBM Business
Partners, as well as members of Rational staff to nominate deployment
practitioners as potential members of the Deployment wiki deployment
practitioners group (also known as Main.TWikiExternalAuthorsGroup).
**Note: Any Rational staff can directly request membership in this group
(see [Deployment wiki request write access for
IBMers](DeploymentRequestWriteAccessForIBMers)).** Members of this group
have write access to specific deployment practitioner and community
pages of the Deployment wiki as described in the [Deployment wiki access
control](DeploymentAccessControl) policy.

## Overview of the nomination process

Nominations to this group will be submitted, reviewed, tracked and
ultimately approved or rejected through Rational Team Concert work
items.

Each nomination will be entered as a single work item and include
relevant data regarding the nominated individual.

A critical aspect of a nomination to this group will be the
identification of an *IBM Rational Sponsor*.

Finally, each nomination should also include a *brief justification* for
the nomination, and include elements such as the individual's deployment
background, types of environments supported or deployed, and so on.

## Submitting a nomination

The steps to submitting a nomination are as follows:

1.  Create a work by using the [Deployment practitioner nomination
    template](https://jazz.net/jazz02/web/projects/Deployment20Wiki#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.newWorkItemSet&tq=1367627721000).
2.  In the Description of the work item, add the requested information.
3.  Add the nominee name and sponsor name to the work item summary where
    indicated:
    `Deployment Practitioner Nomination - [nominee name] - sponsor: [sponsor name]`.
4.  Save the work item.

**Note: Please do not include any other personal or confidential
information about the nominee in the work item.**

## Nomination approval process

Nominations to the deployment practitioners group will require approval
from the identified IBM Rational Sponsor and one of the [Community
technical leaders and senior editors](DeploymentLeaders). Nominees will
be contacted within two weeks of their nomination task being submitted
to inform them of the decision.
