This page describes the reasons you can get a successful build result in
Rational Team Concert when the corresponding Rational Application
Developer build failed, or why a workspace that builds correctly in
Rational Application Developer might fail using Ant builds run by the
Jazz Build Engine.

## Initial assessment

### Symptoms

-   Your Rational Application Developer workspace builds successfully in
    interactive mode. When you try to build it using an Ant script and
    an ANT build in Jazz Build Engine, you get errors like this:

\[javac\] C:\Program Files
(x86)\IBM\TeamConcert\buildsystem\buildengine\eclipse\fetched\ClassName.java:xx:
cannot find symbol \[javac\] symbol : method required() \[javac\]
location: @interface javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlElementRef \[javac\]
@XmlElementRef(name = "name", type = JAXBElement.class, required= false)

-   You run a Rational Application Developer build by invoking a command
    line build with Jazz Build Engine. The Rational Application
    Developer build has errors, but the Jazz Build Engine shows a
    successful build result.

## Data gathering and subsequent analysis steps

-   What type of build definition do you run: command line, Ant,...?
-   What type of Ant tasks do you use? In particular, do you build using
    the following task (from the Ant distribution) or the following task
    (from Rational Application Developer)?

## Possible causes

### Classpath problems

If you are having errors because classes, types, symbols cannot be
resolved, it is likely an issue with the classpath you need to supply to
Such issues can be avoided altogether by using the Rational Application
Developer specific task: This task does not require any classpath setup
(because it reads that information from the project metadata).

### Error propagation problems

If you are using the Rational Application Developer tasks for building
in a command line Rational Team Concert build definition, any errors
reported inside the script are not automatically propagated to the
Rational Team Concert build results. Logic inside your script will need
to perform such error propagation. You will need to use Jazz build Ant
tasks to communicate to the Rational Team Concert build results specific
error messages generated by Rational Application Developer Ant tasks.
This requires that you execute the build inside a shell-sharing
installation of Rational Application Developer and the Rational Team
Concert Client for Eclipse (Extension install).

## Possible solutions

The following two technotes show (with an example) how to solve both
types of problems:

-   If you want to use a command line build definition, see [Integrating
    the Rational Application Developer ANT build scripts in Rational
    Team
    Concert](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21610613)
-   If you want to use an Ant build definition, see [How to launch an
    IBM Rational Application Developer Build from Jazz Build Engine as
    an Ant
    build](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21622655)
