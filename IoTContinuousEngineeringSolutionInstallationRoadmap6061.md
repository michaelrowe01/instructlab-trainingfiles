## Installation terminology

These terms are used in the installation documentation:

Installation directory
:   The location of product artifacts after the package is installed.

Package
:   An installable unit of a software product. Software product packages
    are separately installable units that can operate independently from
    other packages of that software product.

Package group
:   A package group is a directory in which different product packages
    share resources with other packages in the same group. When you
    install a package using Installation Manager, you can create a new
    package group or install the packages into an existing package
    group. (Some packages cannot share a package group, in which case
    the option to use an existing package group is unavailable.)

Repository
:   A storage area where packages are available for download. A
    repository can be disc media, a folder on a local hard disk, or a
    server or web location.

Shared directory
:   In some instances, product packages can share resources. These
    resources are in a directory that the packages share.
