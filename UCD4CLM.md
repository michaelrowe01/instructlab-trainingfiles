## Introduction This page is a work in progress. The objective of the page is a concise explanation of the CLM organizations adoption of IBM Urbancode Deploy, and our efforts to share that work.

### Our Story The CLM Organization is transforming. We are transforming in (at least) two ways. The first is aggressive adoption of lean development principals and DevOps. The objective of this effort is to reduce risk, reduce cost and speed up delivery time of our traditional on premise products. The second transformation our contributions to IBM Bluemix, IBM DevOps Services and Software as a Service. The objective of this effort is to quickly evolve, to learn get feedback and support the industries movement towards cloud centric DevOps.

One part of these efforts is the automation on install, upgrade and
validation of CLM topologies. We have had a lot of success with this
effort both targeting private cloud, public cloud and traditional
infrastructure.

There is more information on our transformation efforts in our blogs

### How our story relates to our customers Customers (unfortunately) often struggle with deployment, upgrade and validation of enterprise CLM deployments. This is the same set of issues that we are dealing with internally as we address Continuous Deployment and Test to production servers.

We would like to test the idea that our own internal automation for both
deployment and test/validation should be shared openly with customers.
We believe that if we share this content in a light weight but
extendable fashion a certain type of customer would benefit greatly in
pulling this content for their own purposes.
