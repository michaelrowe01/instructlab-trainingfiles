End users see not only the Jazz-based tools, but their experience is
largely governed by the software development process that is implemented
in the tools. This section will help you understand the process
enactment in RTC, and will explore ways that you can implement, change,
manage and administer these processes.

## Process enactment introduction

Process in RTC is implemented within the scope of an RTC project.
Different projects may follow different processes, but all users within
the context of a single project will follow the same process. This
process enactment is done using process templates. These templates are
essentially an XML representation of the process that you wish to
follow.

## Enact process

Automate, guide, or enforce the team's behavior when using RTC to
improve adherence to a successful process. Link process description to
the enacted process in RTC whenever possible so team members have an
easy way to understand what they need to do and why they need to do it.

### Process enactment environment

-   Set up a process-oriented CCM instance
-   Improve and maintaining your process
-   Managing process templates

### Configure process

-   Select and customize a template for the first time
-   Attribute customization and display
-   Work item workflows

### Customize process

-   Default value providers
-   Value sets
-   Validators
-   Javascript customization
-   Creating custom operation advisors
-   [Work item attribute customization wiki
    page](Main.AttributeCustomization)

### Process reuse

-   Distribute process through process templates
-   Distribute process through process sharing
-   Fine-grained process customization (delta configs)

## Describe process

Describe the process the team should follow to be successful. Illustrate
the tasks and artifacts that must be produced, Provide guidance on how
to perform those tasks and how to use tools to realize the process.

### Describe a process in RTC

\* Document your process in RTC \* Publish your process in a Rational
Method Composer (RMC) configuration \* Harvest and share process
descriptions

### Integrate the process description with the process in RTC

-   Link from work items to the process description in RTC
-   Link from work items to the published process description in RMC
