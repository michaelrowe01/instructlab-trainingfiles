# Deployment Wiki Community Information [deployment-wiki-community-information]

DKGRAY Authors: Main.SusanYeshin ENDCOLOR

The deployment wiki was created to not only as repository for deployment
related information, but also to as a place where a community of
deployment experts can share information and best practices. The topics
in this section will explain what content belongs on the wiki, how to
join the community, and how to contribute.
