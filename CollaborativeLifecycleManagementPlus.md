# Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM) V6.0 - Integration Overview [collaborative-lifecycle-management-clm-v6.0---integration-overview]

TOC{title="Page contents"}

The Rational solution for Collaborative Lifecycle Management (CLM)
provides integrations across Jazz-based products to connect the work of
analysts with development and test teams. Cross-product links support
traceability, web-like navigation, review, commenting, and status
tracking across project repositories. CLM integrations build on the Jazz
Foundation to provide a common approach to artifact linking, dashboards,
security, and user interface frameworks. CLM integrations provide the
following capabilities:

-   Link to existing artifacts across repositories in integrated
    products; for example, test cases are linked to work items and
    requirements.
-   Hover over links to quickly check the status of associated work; for
    example testers can monitor the status of a defect that they
    reported to the development team.
-   Add a widget to a dashboard to report query results from associated
    projects; for example, you can display requirements that have not
    been assigned test plans.
-   Add comments to any artifact in an integrated repository.

Team members can use CLM integrations to achieve business objectives
across the application lifecycle, as shown in the following figure and
examples:

In **IBM Rational DOORS Requirements Professional:**

-   Requirements are implemented by iteration plans in Rational Team
    Concert and validated by test plans in Rational Quality Manager.
-   Analysts and other team members develop requirements that drive
    development work items, test plans and test cases.

In **IBM Rational Team Concert:**

-   Project managers and development managers use iteration plans to
    implement Rational DOORS Requirements Professional requirements in
    the context of a development schedule.
-   Iteration plan stories and other work items implement individual
    requirements.
-   Developers work on defects that are submitted by testers as a result
    of test execution.

In **IBM Rational Quality Manager:**

-   The test team links requirements to test plans and test cases.
-   Testers link test cases to development work items to track
    development progress.
-   Testers submit defects in Rational Team Concert and verify the
    status of a defect or a build.

### [CLM project page on Jazz.net](https://jazz.net/products/clm/)

The Rational solution for Collaborative Lifecycle Management is a set of
seamlessly integrated tools that work together as one: Rational Team
Concert, Rational Quality Manager, and IBM Rational DOORS Next
Generation.
