Lifecycle Management are Jazz Team Server (JTS), Engineering Workflow
Management (EWM), Engineering Test Management (ETM), and DOORS Next
(DN).

## What's New

**New in Licensing for ELM 7.0.3**:

ELM 7.0.3 improves security by upgrading the cyphers used in licenses.
Older licenses from ELM 7.0.2 and earlier will not work in ELM 7.0.3 and
you must obtain new licenses when you install or upgrade to ELM 7.0.3.
The names, types, and permissions of ELM 7.0.3 licenses is unchanged
from previous ELM 7.x licenses. Request new licenses through the IBM
License Key Center or Passport Advantage as you normally would. See [IBM
Support -
Licensing](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-support-licensing-start-page)
for information on accessing the the License Key Center or Passport
Advantage.

licenses?BR A single user with both an Eclipse client and web session
would only use a single floating license.
