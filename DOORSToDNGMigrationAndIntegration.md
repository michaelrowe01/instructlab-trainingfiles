This page describes guidance and best practice for fully or partially
migrating from IBM Engineering Requirements DOORS 9.x, to IBM
Engineering Requirements DOORS Next 7.x.

A part of the migration process is to assess your current data in DOORS
9.x and prepare it before migrating. It is therefore useful to
understand your data shape using [Calculating your requirements
metrics](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Deployment/CalculatingYourRequirementsMetrics)
to guide you.
