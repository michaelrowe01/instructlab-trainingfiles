# Patch service for CLM applications [patch-service-for-clm-applications]

The RM Patch Service was a new feature for RM 4.0.4 JazzAdmin users.

You use the service to deploy and manage code fixes from the RM
development team to the server by using the /rmadmin page.

Note that this was an RM-only feature prior to CLM 5.0. In CLM 5.0, this
was introduced to the other CLM applications as a new service which
allows you to dynamically add code changes to any build, without having
to run a personal build. These code modifications are referred to
throughout this document as "patches" or "hot-fixes".
