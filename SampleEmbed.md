## Embedding a YouTube video

1.  Navigate to the video on YouTube
2.  Click on **Share**, then **Embed**. YouTube automatically generates
    embed code.
3.  To ensure consistency in the wiki, select "Custom size" for the
    video and set the dimensions to 450 x 253.
4.  Copy and past the automatically generated code into the wiki page
    you are editing. Do not introduce any line breaks into the code.
5.  Introduce your video with a brief explanation; for example, "This
    video demonstrates how to configure an OSLC integration."

The following code

displays this video:

**Note:** You might need to reload the page before the sample video is
shown.

As an alternate option, you can embed a video from YouTube or similar
source by using the HTML tag.

## Posting new videos on YouTube

Rational Deployment has its own [YouTube
channel](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGCUXUxpG-g8zm_5Z7qVYgg) for
posting new videos that you want to embed in the wiki. We encourage you
to post all deployment-related videos on the Deployment channel. To post
a video, contact the channel administrators, Jason Green or Ralph Earle,
via email or by opening a work item.

## Guidelines for creating videos

### Video

-   As specified at Recording a Software Demonstration and Video
    Recording Templates, record and produce work in an HD widescreen
    format (1080p or 720p). YouTubes player accepts videos at 16:9
    (\~1.78) natively. Videos at other aspect ratios will be
    automatically letter/pillar boxed. Videos at low resolutions will
    show poorly at modern display resolutions.
-   Do not add letter or pillar boxes to your videos. These will be
    added by the player as is necessary.
-   Upload video in its best quality, original format. The more times
    something undergoes lossy compression, the worse it looks.
-   Dont show non-public URLs or personally identifiable information.
    Hide navigation, menu, and status bars when you record browser
    activity. Use dummy usernames, too--allow yourself to truly be Tanuj
    from JKE Banking. If you forget to do this, its not the end of the
    world--use image and blurring callouts to change or obscure private
    information.
-   Hiding browser features (as well as the task bar) allows you to
    devote maximum space to featured software.

### Audio

-   Include audio! When it comes to multimedia, silence is not golden.
-   Record using an external USB or professional microphone. Never use a
    laptop microphone to record--no matter how convenient it seems, the
    results are not worth it. Some headset microphones can also be
    problematic, as head movement might displace the boom, resulting in
    noise and subtle changes to volume. Test before recording to
    determine if this is a problem for you.
-   Experiment with microphone positions to achieve the best sound.
    Different microphones prefer different amounts of space.
    Additionally, some microphones will sound best when spoken over or
    under rather than head on.
-   TEST your audio. Playback the very first track you record. If you
    are using a USB headset and proper settings, it should sound crystal
    clear. No hums, dropouts, buzzing, clicks, or pops. USB headsets are
    very accurate capture devices. And a single voice is very simple to
    reporduce for modern audio equipment.
-   Record audio at a high quality (at least 160 kbps, preferably). For
    advanced users who are publishing an imported webinar in .mov
    format, even higher quality may be necessary to achieve acceptable
    audio quality in the published video file.
-   If you are using a 3rd-party Audio tool like Audacity, DO NOT use
    the noise reduction feature unless it is absolutely necessary. If
    you recorded your audio with a proper USB headset, it is not
    necessary. If you are trying to clean-up your audio after recording
    it, chances are your settings were off when you originally recorded
    the audio. Check your system audio settings for both external and
    internal audio devices.
-   Note: You may have to disable your native computer speakers AND
    native mic in order to use your USB headset. Use the control panel
    device manager.

### Style considerations

**Video**

-   Consistency is key. Once you do something one way in a video, dont
    change it drastically again without reason (keep highlight shades
    the same unless youre color coding, for example, and dont use a
    mishmash of fonts). Keep pacing consistent, too.
-   Text-filled callouts (as in "Show Me" videos) are not stylistically
    appropriate for modern videos. Instead, use highlighting techniques
    and appropriate narration.
-   When detailing every single step of a process is not a concern, make
    use of transitions between scenes (such as cuts, wipes, dissolves,
    and fades) to save you and your audience time. Dont go overboard:
    pick one or two to use consistently, and avoid elaborate
    transitions. Fancy transitions, like spinning polygons with
    screencaps for faces, can be too busy for simply moving from one
    screencap to another similar one.

**Audio**

-   Consider using a pop filter when recording to prevent plosive sounds
    from popping into your audio track. Cheap ones are available for
    around \$15. If you enjoy arts and crafts, make your own for much
    less: <http://www.deansabatino.com/2005/08/21/67/>
-   Advanced Users: Make use of the compress, EQ, and noise removal
    tools available in Audacity (<http://audacity.sourceforge.net/>).
    Practice with them, as achieving a good sound is equal parts art and
    science.
    -   Compression reduces variations in volume.
    -   EQ can make a VO warmer by, for example, emphasizing mid-range
        frequencies (start looking around 1 kHz)
    -   Noise removal can be key--what is thought of as a quiet room in
        an office environment is plenty loud in an audio recording
        context. Pick a quiet section of track and train the noise
        removal tool on it to silence things like forced air systems and
        computer fans.

### Content and Script Considerations

-   Is the information you want to communicate best conveyed by video?
    Simple but time-consuming, repetitive tasks, for example, might not
    be appropriate for an exhaustive demonstration. Do not assume that
    the user has enough context for detailed product-specific tasks.
-   Who is your target audience? Are there differences between the sorts
    of viewers who will watch your video within IC context versus those
    who might watch stumble onto it on YouTube? Should this inform
    content and/or presentation?
-   What do you want to communicate? Can you break this down into a few
    points? Is this an appropriate amount of information for the
    intended running time of the video?
-   Where will your video fit in the context of others in its series? Of
    Rational video offerings as a whole?
-   What do you want viewers to take away from the video? Knowledge of
    how to perform a new task is great, but try to identify an emotional
    angle (empowerment, relief/destressing, control, and even excitement
    might come to mind), too. Even the lowliest of task videos will
    probably make someones life easier, or allow them to do something
    that they couldnt have done before, so frame the topic to show that.
-   What will viewers do after watching the video? Is it probable that
    theyll be spurred to work using their newfound knowledge, or is it
    more likely (in the case of high concept videos) that they will
    continue on with some research? Use this to inform your conclusion,
    as well as what links and tags will appear with your video.
-   As you script a voice over, read the text aloud. Its terribly easy
    to sound a bit stiff--especially if youre using a lot of
    documentation as source material--but remember that writing for the
    audio-visual medium is its own beast. Try for somewhere between
    relaxed and formal. Its just like dressing for the office: business
    casual.
-   Be sure to indicate at the beginning and end of the video how the
    presented task or concept empowers the user to do more than they
    could before. Don't just show how to do something so that it can be
    repeatedexplain why that something is done.
