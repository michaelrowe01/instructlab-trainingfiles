# Performance troubleshooting situation template [performance-troubleshooting-situation-template]

DKGRAY Authors: Main.GrantCovell Build basis: None ENDCOLOR

TOC{title="Page contents"}

-   Directly under the header-title box, there should be a concise page
    description.
-   Remember that each page should be self-contained. Potential readers
    may arrive here by Internet search or via a link, and so the page
    should be reasonably self-explanatory.

## Initial assessment

-   Be as specific as possible. These suggested sub-sections may not be
    relevant or appropriate for each situation. However, please try to
    specify: application, user role, platform, etc.

### Symptoms

-   "When you do X, Y happens"

### Impact / scope

-   Does it effect multiple users? A particular type of client?

### Timing (when)

-   When did the problem start to occur?
-   Is the problem repeatable?

### Environmental changes

-   What sort of things may have changed in the environment (outside the
    products) to have caused the problem?
-   Hardware / software / network / client

| As amnifier technician, using all versions of the Turboencabulator after model H4500, when attempting to process retro-finned cordobite amnifiers with length in the range 2.4 to 7.4 cm, the main sub-control panel reports error -52X-3C immediately upon processing. |

## Recommended data gathering and subsequent analysis steps

-   Link to other, separate self-contained pages which offer concrete
    domain analysis (how to analyze AIX lpars, x86 virtualization, JVM
    heap); use parts of Tox' doc which provides high-level concepts of
    how things work (authentication, etc.); how to begin to look if you
    don't understand the whole process.

| Understanding Turboencabulator errors of class -52X, Amnifier routines |

## Possible causes

-   Clearly identify possible causes for the problem.

|  |
|----|
| 1\) Turboencabulator bearings on the reverse-transfold mechanisms often wear out after 36,000 revolutions, or 2) Main sub-control panel erroneously reports errors when bifold gateway requires updating to patch-level 9.0.4.2700 |

## Possible solutions

-   Clearly identify possible solutions to the problem.

|  |
|----|
| 1\) Replace the oxoid geframitz chute and the obloid rotator mechanism, or 2) Install patch level 9.0.4.56 or greater |

-   Sometimes causes and solutions may go together especially if there's
    an evident cause and effect.
