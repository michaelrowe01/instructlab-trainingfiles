STARTSECTION{"Intro"} This scenario is consider one of the "Additional"
ones, as it's not part of the standard set of test scenarios executed
every time (i.e. in every release), as part of the RTCEE Benchmark
Tests. The specific scenarios in this category will vary because they
are specially designed in every release to test the features that have
performance related changes.

Note: For detail scenarios, please refer to 'Test Report' section to get
the specific feature test you interested on. ENDSECTION{"Intro"}
